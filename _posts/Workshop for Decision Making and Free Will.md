# Workshop for Decision Making and Free Will

## Cortical-amygdala circulit

## Introduction

Decision making; reason about future; decide reward value; from stimulus to outcome  
Incentive value; reward pursuit; history value on the current situation; reward value encoding  

#### Learning and retrieval of value

Training: lever for sugar; learn sugar is more important when hungary

Q: mouse know sugar is?

BLA glutamate activity  track reward value encoding; OFC support BLA for reward encoding  
Knock down of the circuit prevent the learning of value; stimulating the circuit assign greater values to sugar; lateral OFC to BLA projection  
Activation of the circuit also helps to retrieve the learned value   
Learn the difference of sugar under different level of hungry  
Lateal OFC: incentive value encoding; medial OFC inventive value retrieval  

#### Learning of stimulus-reward relation 

Remind the choice; outcome-specific Pavlovian to instrumental transfer  
Use stimulus to sugar or food; cue-directed action   
Learn the stimulus to reward relation;  BLA: decision making circuitry   
Dysfunction may lead to addiction

#### Summary

lOFC to BLA & mOFC to BLA projections mediate the encoding & retrieval of state-dependent reward memories to promote adaptive reward pursuit 

## Animal Have to Make Rapid Behavioral Decisions in Survival Situations

### David Anderson, Caltech

[Rapid decision making is related to low intelligence, like in politics]

#### Introduction

Behavioral decision making; defensive instinct; reproductive instinct; hierarchics of decision; binary control; analog control (by hermone or accumulation)  
Continuous increasing of stimulation; decreasing of threat distance; electrical stimulation intensity: inject current to chicken brain  
Behavior and internal state encoding in an inner fear pathways; VMH; activate certain cell populations

#### Results

Different stimulation gives different defensive behavior: freezing and fleeing  
Control of social behaviors;; activation of attack behavior (or inhibition)    
Rheostat control of behavioral decision; aggressive behavior: dominance mounting to attacking  
Control of threat in flies; social behavior circulatory  
Control of attacking to sexual mounting MPO activity; VMHvl 
Ultrasonic vocalization  
Female cues: MPO: mating; male cues: VMHvl: aggression  
Cortex: electronic brain; amygdala/hypothalamus: hydraulic brain  
Sexual inexperianced male mouse have the same neuron population they diffantiate after sexual experience  
Female have differetn population to agression to mating 

#### Summary 

## Freewill, Determinism and Survival

### Dean Mobbs, Caltech

#### Introduction

Rational agents to choose; decision theory; survival theory  
Quick and deterministic & slow and strategic; different circuit; spatiotemporal dynamics of danger  
Survival stragagies for differetn ecological conditons   
Reactive fear; cognitive fear; time scales  
Active escape task; switch of activated region with differetnt distance   
Thigmotaxis and axiety ; maze with caged or not caged predator  
The econmics of flee; cost not flee and cost of not flee; different attack speed. subject choose when to flee  
Fast attack: reactive fear; Slow attack: cognitive fear; trait anxiety and flight distance  
Fear is a dynamic process; distal or slow danger: proximal attack   
Reduce the risk of predationï¼› freewill to choose between options to think out of predators 

## Model-based and Model-free Reinforcement Learning in the Brain

### John O'Doherly, Caltech

#### Introduction 

Goals vs habits; goal-directed control; habitual control; rewards based the past with the same context  
How to learn model-free tasks; Markov decision task; reinforcement-learning model: expectation of reward learned on the prediction error; dopamine neurons activity similar to prediction errors   
How does the brain learn model specific models; state prediction error  
How do decide which system to use; trade-off; model-based: precise, computational expensive, risk of poor model; model-free: low precision, noisy, computational easier  
Reliability of the predictions ; state-reward prediction error  
Manipulation: change reward, state uncertainty  
Arbitration mechanism; effective connectivity between arbitrator and model-free values   
Stimulation of the region change the state between model-based or model-free  
Two different mechanisms for controling behavior; arbitration depends on their respective reliabilities, task complexity

## Behavioral Economics and Decision Neuroscience

### Colin Camerer, Caltech

#### Introduction

Facts about limits on computation, willpower and self-interest are used to improve economic prediction; neuroeconomics: biological implementation  
Hypothesized decision process; statistical behavioral fit; observed choices  
Marginal costs and benefits matter; consequentialism: only net wealth matters; lost and gain asymmetry  
Sunk cost; concorde fallacy; all-you-can-eat pizza; travel decision;  loss-aversion  
Reference point goa;a in IronMan triathions 

## 

### Annie Duke

equating the quality of a decision with the quality of the outcome  
Poker: decision making with uncertainty over time; bet on particular future  
Hear; believe; vet; after have a belief: seek out confirming evidence, discrediting contradicting evidence  
Reduce bias; forming an intertional that roup supports resoning to be accurate rather thatn right; ignore short-term outcomes; deep exploration of counterfactual lines

## Free Will, Agency, and Psychological Explanation 

### Rosa Cao, Stanford

#### Introduction 

Determinism; does the future need to be open to be free; libertarians; too late to the show; brains decide before we know  
Compatibilism; others; liberterialism; no free will  
Is the future open? If yes, agent causation? things could be otherwise?  
Compatibilism: freedom as self-determination or autonomy  
Cannot will what he will  
Higher level causes real; epistemic uncertainty: indistinguishable microstates;  Gregorian creature is cpable of self-evaluation and self-modification 

## Free Will from a Physics Standpoint

### Anton Kapustin, Caltech

#### Introduction

Make choices not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention  
Classical physics; completely deterministic;  Laplace's demon  
Quantum theory; measurement; Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg; Pascual Jordan; Erwin Schrodinger: quantum Laplace's demon  
No local hidden variables; wavefunction deterministic; intelligent observers is not special; interaction between two physical objects, one of which is macroscpic;  
Emergence of the arrow of time; role of initial condition   
Free will is not unpredictability  
Free will of AI system; reason to make choices and change decision rules with extra information   
Free will as a social phenomenon, Elbow Room, Freedom Evolves   
Consciousness is an implicit pre-condition   
Arrow of Time and free will both are emergent properties

## Free Choice and Implicit Intent

### Richard Andersen, Caltech

Animal studies : posterior parietal cortex  
Map of intended movements in posterior parietal cortex of non-human primates  
Free choice of effector (eye movement and reach); preplan movements   
Use intent signal for neuroprosthetics o assist tetraplegic humans   
Finger control from grasp area  
Libet experiment: single neurons  
Posterior parietal cortex plays a role of making free choices; implicit (pre-conscious) intent

## Human Intention and Agency 

### Shinsuke Shimojo, Caltech

Neuron determinism, and can it exercise free view; intention to action  
Central dogma in neuroscience; all mental phenomena have neural correlates; neuroscientific determinism  
Caveats: merging multiple timelines, EEG averages over many trials; keep track of time  
Philosophical attempts; compatibilism, dualism  
Neural Reuctionism won't eliminate the sense of agency: feeling of free choice in postdictive; feeling of free choice is a matter of content; feeling of free choice is very much like a perceptual illusion 

TMS; motor cortex stimulation; EMG, muscle recording; voluntary movements + TMS  
Same side: wrong time perception; the other side: percieve corrent time order; activate finger directly: no confusion  
Chronometry of mental timeline: vary delays, reduce intensity as time marker, critical components of muscle feedback  
EEG; neural correlates; readiness potential; prediction of reaction  
Brain's decision on free will is very ambiguous and context-dependent; feeling of intension and action may depend on processes occuring after the action; the internal feeling of intention may be subject to many of the same rules as the sensory pereption of the external world
