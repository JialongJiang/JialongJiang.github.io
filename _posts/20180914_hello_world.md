Welcome to the world of my website!

# Prologue

I have long been thinking about building my website but just actually started, motivated by the endeavors of my friends. I believe writing is a very special way of communication, as time is not a constraint anymore, both for writers and readers. 

I plan to post mostly on academic stuff, trying to convey my taste of science. There is a long journey to go in the beauty of nature and rationality. *O brave new world!*
