The method of large deviation is wildly applied in probility, stochastic processes and statistical inference. In the context of maximum likelihood estimation, large deviation rate determines how the error probility decreases with the accumulation of i.i.d. samples. The large deviation distance in inverse Ising model turn out to have the form of partition function, which helps us to recognize the importance of the partition function apart from merely a normalizing constant.
