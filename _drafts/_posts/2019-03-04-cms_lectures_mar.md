Happy new year 9012! I haven't got time to sort out my notes but finally resume the effort. I just finished my first draft on the project stating from Augest last year!

## A Glimpse into the Value of Information in Strategic Interaction

### Vijay Subramanian, UMichigan	03/04/2019

Sequential social learning; E-commerce platform; correct decision; design questions  
Private signals; past agents action; comments from experts  
Information cascade; individual decision; wrong cascade  
BHW model; binary states; Bayes rational agents with action; private signal; fully observable; utility function  
Finite time agents herd; information cascade; private signals don't help  
If likelihood ratio bounded, information cascade happens; otherwise asymptotic learning  
Distorted history; learning achieved; platform assumed to benign  
Imperfect observations; non-Bayesian agent; consensus problem  
Bayesian persuasion  

Deterministic network topology with finite channel capacity; question previous agents after private signal  
Network topology is common knowledge; agent asks all questions simultaneously  
Question guidebooks as common knowledge  
Questions being feasible; maximize utility over all possible questions; active: positive probability to stop cascade; otherwise silent; asymptotic learning  
Greedy question guidebooks; odd-index; even-index  
Markov Chain  
Telephone-game network; threshold-based strategy



Target tracking; distribution estimation localization; parametric model; nonparametric; kernel density estimation  
Lowering dimensionality of kernel density map; covariance operator; Mercer's theorem; data to recover function; KPCA

Distillation; not input-output mapping; but eigenspace  
Training costs; symmetrized eigenproblem; empirical density; quantized operation  
Nystrom methods; density-weighted method; submodular; set-covering; error estimation; 

Learning for control; kernel machines for adaptive control; persistency of excitation   
Spectral structure; catastrophic forgetting; zero eigenvalues in large network  
Gaussian process for kernel machines; disturbance rejection
