I'm currently a graduate student at California Institute of Technology. I am interested in understanding the mariad of phenomena in living systems by quantitive approaches. The following topics are especially exciting to me:

* Living systems stay in non-equilibrium regiem by actively extracting energy from environment.  What makes life so special as a physical system compared with its inorganic environment?
* Biological systems operate under large thermal fluctuations and populational variance. How do them control or even utilize these noise under the limited facilities available?
* As the development of high-throughput experimental methods, such as imaging, single-cell sequencing, large quantities of experimental data contain abundent information. How to build interpretable statistical learning models to extract the information?
* Complex networks play important roles in many aspects of life, and enormous functions arise from the complexity, like learning, memory, etc. How are these functions achieved and what are the key features to implement them?

I got my B.S. in Integrated Science at Peking University, where I was first exposed to scientific research, and the fancinating area of understanding living systems with quantitative reasonings. Even though I primarily received physics training in my undergrad years, I turn to more mathematical approaches since I came here. Physics models are fun, but sometimes the model selection trap is frustrating. Therefore I'd like to know what can we deduce from more abstract and high-level assumptions, and also how to use them to extract information from experimental data. 

I play guitar fingerstyle in my part time. I enjoy the variety of techniques in fingerstyle to make different timbres, and also the chord of six strings.
